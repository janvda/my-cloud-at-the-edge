# My Cloud at the edge

## What ?

A description of the setup of *my cloud at the edge* = 

 * a set of [raspberry pi devices](./topics/raspberry_pi/README.md) and [intel NUC](./topics/intel_nuc/README.md) devices 
 * connected to my home LAN
 * running docker
 * which are managed from my MacBook.

This will be covered in several sessions and topics

 * with focus on *my **practical** experience*
 * that are *energy* and *budget friendly*
 * (mainly) make use of *open source software*

 The different (planned) sessions and topics can be found in the top menu bar.
## Why ?

* inspire and help others 
    * to create their own private cloud at the edge or 
    * to implement some of the topics at home
* learn about cloud concepts (docker, containers, images, ...), networking, ...

## Prerequisite skills

No prerequisite skills to follow the sessions.

Having some basic **linux** skills would be very helpful if you want to apply this in your edge environment.
